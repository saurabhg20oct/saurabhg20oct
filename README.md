# Hi, I'm Saurabh 👋

Quality Engineering Specialist | Automation Lead | Trying to make flaky tests extinct

I’ve spent the last 11+ years designing and breaking large-scale systems (politely).  
Currently at **GOTO COMPANY (Gojek-Tokopedia)**, ensuring software behaves better than most people do under pressure.

---

### 🔍 What I actually do
- Build scalable **API & UI automation frameworks** (Java | TestNG | RestAssured | Selenium | Gradle | Allure)
- Lead **test automation dependent releases** across teams
- Solve real-world problems using **use-case based testing strategies**
- Mentor teams and quietly panic when someone says _“we’ll test it in prod”_

### 💻 Tech & Tools I trust with my sanity
| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Languages | Java, Go (getting serious), Python (soon) |
| Test Automation | TestNG, RestAssured, Selenium |
| DevOps & CI | Jenkins, Docker, Gradle |
| Reporting | Allure |
| Performance | K6, Gatling (upcoming) |
| AI & LLM | Prompt Engineering, GenAI-Augmented QA(Currently Exploring Possibilities) |
| Trading Experiments | Python-based technical analysis & indicator automation |

### 🚀 Currently Exploring
- **Autonomous Agents & LLM-driven test automation**
- **Algorithmic trading for Indian markets**
- **How to debug life decisions using stack traces(read overthinking)**

---

### 🏆 Some Wins
- Built testing frameworks used across org teams  
- Streamlined release cycles by automating critical test dependencies  
- Convinced people that quality isn’t a department, it’s a habit

### 📚 What I write about on Medium
- Software quality engineering  
- Testing philosophy & automation frameworks  
- Male loneliness epidemic, personal finance & resilience  
- That time I became debt-free at 35 and people thought I was joking

### 💡 Fun Fact
I don't break code. I just help it discover who it truly is under pressure. I act like Sherlock Holmes in IT industry.
